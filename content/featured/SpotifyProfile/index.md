A web app for detecting [cyberbullying](https://www.statista.com/topics/1809/cyber-bullying/#topicOverview) on social media that others fail to detect- even the [GenZ lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Generation_Z_slang). Helping at stances that make the victim feel inadequate and 
unduly self-conscious and even lead to suicidal thoughts.
[P.S. Secured a patent for this as well ]
